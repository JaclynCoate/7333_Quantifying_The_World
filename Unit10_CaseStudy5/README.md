# Missig Data and Imputation Methods
## Introduction

In statistics the process of replacing missing data is referred to as imputation. Imputation is often preferred to dropping missing data in real world data analysis scenarios. This is becasue the ability to successfully imputate data allows researchers to salvage datasets in their entirety or at a minimum retaining contributing portions of data that would otherwise need to be discarded. 

The absense of imputation results in researchers struggling against problmes such as having ommitted variable biases (due to lost data) and therefore the dataset not being truly a respresentative samples. On the same page any output results would not be statistically accurate or representative of the population. Trying to analyze around missing data can create efficiency issues as well as handling the data overall more difficult (Barnard 1999). 

After an imputation method has been inacted on data then traditional and standard methods can be used to analyze the data. As we work through this case study we will be examining different imputation techniques to see which performs best on our dataset.
