# Location Prediction with Indoor Positioning Systems
## Introduction
There are around 5 billion unique smartphones in the world today. We often don't reflect on how we have the ability to know where we are, where our friends/family are, and even our lost devices at our fingertips. These are a few of the many reasons there is an unprecedented growth of wireless networks. With this growth comes the interest in being able to track individuals and devices both in the world and within standing structures. Global Position Systems (GPS) are very effective in tracking different things outdoors, however, are not reliable for tracking people/things within structures. Indoor positioning systems (IPS) have started to leverage wireless local area networks (LANs) and WiFi signals to address challenges such as: Where is this printer? Where is the ventilator in the hospital? What level is this rental car parked so I can go grab it for this customer?

### Feedback

Excellent Report.  Very different from the book, but well done.  One word of caution though--be sure you are targeting the correct metric.  In this exercise since it was a mess, we didn't talk too much about the RMSE, and your team went with accuracy which makes this more a classification problem. However, in this case it is a valid choice to choose location as a class rather than an regression.  Just be wary that it may not always be the case.

With the minor aside, very nice job.
