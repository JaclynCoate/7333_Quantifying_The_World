# Hunt for the Higgs Bosons with Deep Neural Networks
## Introduction

The ongoing hunt for the building blocks of our universe is something the physics community has been leading for decades. Most recently the Higgs Boson particle was discovered in high-energy physics (also known as particle physics) experimentation. The branch of high-energy physics is the idea of being able to identify those smallest components of matter and radiation [1]. The idea is that these elementary components are the building blocks that allow us to understand the behavior of those observable traits in our universe. The current and most dominant theory in the industry is termed the _Standard Model_; and the most recent discovered particle is called the _Higgs boson_. Discovered in 2012 by European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) with the large hadron collider [2]. 

The _Higgs boson_ particle is the newest particle discovered by physicists. In order to discover a particle physicists have to successfully isolate a “subspace of their high-dimensional data” [3] where the hypothesis of a potential new particle (force) produces a significant difference than the null hypothesis of no difference. This frame allows for statistical testing to take place and help determine if a new particle/force exists. The process that is responsible for the production of the _higgs boson_ was a previously unknown to physicists, the researchers leveraged the Monte Carlo simulations to build models that would allow the sample processes signals to be generated and therefore classify if a signal processes is likely to or not to produce _higgs boson_. Monte Carlo simulations are particularly skilled at the studies of properties of tests when assumptions that they are pulled from are not necessarily met. Due to this fact, researchers leveraged this method for the _higgs boson_ research. Deep learning algorithms are particularly talented in obtaining inference from large amounts of data when there are very small differences to indicate signal and therefore class separation, the Monte Carlo simulations created 11 million signals,  Baldi, Sadowski, and Whiteson decided to leverage deep neural networks (DNNs). In the instance of these data the researchers used 28 different features, 21 of kinematic properties and the additional 7 engineered features. These 7 engineered features were created from functions of those original 21 features that allow the researchers to determine between the two classes of signals that either indicate the presence of a _higgs boson_ or no _higgs boson_. In the following case study we used those details in the researcher’s paper in an attempt to reconstruct their study and reproduce their results. We will discuss those steps we took to produce the same research, we also will discuss those challenges we encountered and things we discovered in our efforts.
